# histogram-based-image-retrieval
Inspired by a school project, I created a library that permit :
- Creation of an image histogram based on grey level or RGB level
- Indexation of histograms in file
- Comparing histogram and search the closest in index.

To use it, simply add histogram-based-image-retrieval.jar to your project.

Documentation is available here :

DemoImageRetrieval is a demo project of a website using the library
